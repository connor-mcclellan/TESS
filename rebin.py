# Structure of incoming data will always consist of time stamps, flux values, 
# and exposure times.

# There will be gaps in the data. These gaps can be replaced with either the 
# median flux of the time series, or left at 0.

# TERMINOLOGY:
#
#    bins - the evenly-spaced "new" bins that the flux data will be distributed
#           into
#
#    binwidth - the width of the bins, in units of time
#
#    time - the time stamps from the original time series
#
#    flux - the flux data from the original time series
#
#    timeseries - the original time series (time and flux)
#
#    exptime - the exposure time for each frame of the time series
#
#    timestamp_position - the position of the time stamp relative to the 
#                         exposure
#
#                   0   - the time stamp is at the beginning of each exposure
#                   0.5 - the time stamp is in the middle of each exposure
#                   1   - the time stamp is at the end of each exposure

    """
    Rebin a time series into evenly-spaced bins, the number of which is a power
     of two for fast fourier transform compatibility.

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeseries : numpy array or astropy table
        The time series to be rebinned, consisting of two columns: timestamps
        and fluxes, in that order.
    binwidth : scalar, optional
        The width, in the same units of time as the timeseries, of each bin 
        into which the fluxes from the timeseries will be distributed. If not
        provided, it will be inferred from the original time series.
    exptime : scalar, optional
        The exposure time, in the same units of time as the timeseries, of each
        image taken. If not provided, it will be inferred from the original 
        time series.
    timestamp_position : scalar, optional
        The position of the time stamp relative to each exposure. Values are
        0 - the time stamp is at the beginning of each exposure; 0.5 - the time
        stamp is in the middle of each exposure; 1 - the time stamp is at the
        end of each exposure.
    median_replace : boolean, optional
        If true, gaps in the timeseries will be replaced with the median flux
        of all the data points.

    Returns
    -------
    a : array
        A two-column numpy array containing timestamps and fluxes in evenly-
        spaced bins. Timestamps indicate the beginning of each bin.
